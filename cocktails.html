<h3>Negroni</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 oz gin
<li>1 oz campari
<li>1 oz sweet vermouth
<li>1 orange or grapefruit twist
</ul>

Combine all the booze with ice in a mixing glass (though, I always stir in a metal shaking tin) and stir for 2 minutes (yes, it takes that long to bring the cocktail down to temp and achieve proper dilution... assuming normal sized ice cubes.) A Negroni works great either up or on the rocks, so strain it into the vessel of your choice and serve with either an orange or grapefruit twist.

<h3>Manhattan</h3>
<ul>
<li>2oz rye
<li>0.875 oz sweet vermouth
<li>2 dashes angostura bitters
<li>1 Maraschino cherry
</ul>

Combine rye, vermouth, and bitters in a mixing vessel and stir for 2 minutes. Strain into a chilled coupe glass and add the cherry. (You can also use an orange twist, if you prefer.)

<h3>Old-Fashioned</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 dashes Angostura bitters
<li>2 oz bourbon
<li>3/8 oz simple syrup
<li>1 orange twist
<li>1 Maraschino cherry
</ul>

This is the best way to build an old-fashioned:
Put ice (this recipe is extra fun if you can use one giant ice cube, but three or four normal sized ones will work fine) into an old-fashioned glass.
Put two dashes of Angostura bitters right onto the ice.
Pour the bourbon over the bitters.
Pour in the simple syrup
Give it a brief stir.
Quickly wring the orange peel right over the top of the glass, wipe the rim with it, and then set it in the drink.
Add the cherry.

<h3>Final Ward</h3>
<ul>
<li>3/4 oz rye
<li>3/4 oz Green Chartreuse
<li>3/4 oz Maraschino liqueur
<li>3/4 oz fresh squeezed lemon juice
<li>1 Maraschino cherry
</ul>

Combine the rye, Chartreuse, Maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with the cherry. 

<h3>Daiquiri</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 oz white rum
<li>0.875 oz lime juice
<li>3/4 oz simple syrup
</ul>

Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe glass.


<h4>Notes:</h4>
If you're not serving a cocktail on the rocks, it's always best to use chilled glassware.
Simple syrup is super easy to make at home: just combine equal weights (weight, not volume) water and granulated sugar in a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds.
