			<b>Negroni</b>
			<ul>
<li>1 oz gin
<li>1 oz campari
<li>1 oz sweet vermouth
<li>1 orange or grapefruit twist
	</ul>

Combine all the booze with ice in a mixing glass (though, I always stir in a metal shaking tin) and stir for 2 minutes (yes, it takes that long to bring the cocktail down to temp and achieve proper dilution... assuming normal sized ice cubes.) A Negroni works great either up or on the rocks, so strain it into the vessel of your choice and serve with either an orange or grapefruit twist.

<b>Manhattan</b>
2oz rye
0.875 oz sweet vermouth
2 dashes angostura bitters
1 Maraschino cherry

Combine rye, vermouth, and bitters in a mixing vessel and stir for 2 minutes. Strain into a chilled coupe glass and add the cherry. (You can also use an orange twist, if you prefer.)

Old-Fashioned:
2 dashes Angostura bitters
2 oz bourbon
3/8 oz simple syrup
1 orange twist
1 Maraschino cherry

This is the best way to build an old-fashioned:
Put ice (this recipe is extra fun if you can use one giant ice cube, but three or four normal sized ones will work fine) into an old-fashioned glass.
Put two dashes of Angostura bitters right onto the ice.
Pour the bourbon over the bitters.
Pour in the simple syrup
Give it a brief stir.
Quickly wring the orange peel right over the top of the glass, wipe the rim with it, and then set it in the drink.
Add the cherry.
Final Ward:
3/4 oz rye
3/4 oz Green Chartreuse
3/4 oz Maraschino liqueur
3/4 oz fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 Maraschino cherry

Combine the rye, Chartreuse, Maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with the cherry. 

Daiquiri:
2 oz white rum
0.875 oz lime juice
3/4 oz simple syrup

Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe glass.


Notes:
If you're not serving a cocktail on the rocks, it's always best to use chilled glassware.
Simple syrup is super easy to make at home: just combine equal weights (weight, not volume) water and granulated sugar in a blender and blend on high for 30 seconds.
